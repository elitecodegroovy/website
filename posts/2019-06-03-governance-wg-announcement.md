Hey all! Today we're happy to announce the [Governance Working Group](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/governance-working-group-announcement/9637) is going public. We've been spending the last couple weeks finding our bearings and structuring the working group.

You can find [our charter](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/CHARTER.md) outlining our main goals and priorities in [our work repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance). We are using the Github issues, milestones and projects to organise and track our progress. The [readme in the repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/) explains our working process a bit more in detail. It also states how you can talk to us (hint, via discord) and [get involved](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/#how-can-i-get-involved).

If you're interested in the governance working group, you may also be interested in the [Lang Team Meta WG](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/lang-team-meta-working-group/9989), which is exploring solutions specific to the lang team.
