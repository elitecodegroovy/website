title: "Changes in the core team"
author: The Rust Core Team

Just a quick update: You may have noticed that, in the last month or
so, a number of [Rust core team] members have changed their jobs
and/or their roles in the project. Two people have decided to step
back from the core team:

[Rust core team]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/core

- Nick Cameron [left Mozilla to work at PingCap][nrc]. Although he
  won’t have time to stay active on the core team, he plans to
  continue co-leading the Cargo team in his new position.
- Aaron Turon [decided to step back from the core team][aturon] so
  that he could focus on engineering work and the language design
  team. (He remains on the Rust team at Mozilla.)

[aturon]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/aturon-retires-from-the-core-team-but-not-from-rust/9392/3

With Rust 2018 having shipped, this is a natural time of
transition. While we’ll miss Nick and Aaron’s contributions to the
core team, we are very excited for them to be focusing on something
new, and we’re very happy that they are still going to stay involved
with Rust. We’re also looking into growing the core team to help with
the work ahead.

Finally, two other members have changed their jobs, but plan to stay
involved in the core team:

- Ashley Williams [joined Cloudflare and plans to work on Rust and WASM integration there][ag_dubs].
  She will be remaining on the core team. 
- Steve Klabnik [left Mozilla, but will remain on the core team.][steveklabnik]

That’s it!
