Welcome to the inaugural post of the **Inside Rust** blog! This is a
new blog where the various Rust teams and working groups can post
updates about new developments. It's a great place to watch if you're
interested in following along with Rust development -- and a
particularly great place to watch if you're interested in contributing
to Rust. Expect to see updates on new projects, calls for help, design
notes, and other similar items. Thanks for reading!
